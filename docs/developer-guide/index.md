In order to work with ESLint as a developer, it's recommended that:

为了作为一个开发者参与到ESLint项目中，推荐：

* You know JavaScript, since ESLint is written in JavaScript.
* 你熟悉JavaScript，因为ESLint是用Javascript写的。
* You have some familiarity with Node.js, since ESLint runs on it.
* 你对Node.js有一定的了解，因为ESLint运行Node.js上。
* You're comfortable with command-line programs.
* 你熟悉命令行编程。
* You understand unit tests and why they're important.
* 你了解单元测试，知道他们的重要性。

If that sounds like you, then continue reading to get started.

如果上面说的都符合你，那么继续阅读。

## Section 1: Get the [Source Code](source-code)

Before you can get started, you'll need to get a copy of the ESLint source code. This section explains how to do that and a little about the source code structure.

在你开始之前，你需要获取ESLint的源码。本节解释如何获取源码和源码结构。

## Section 2: Set up a [Development Environment](development-environment)

Developing for ESLint is a bit different than running it on the command line. This section shows you how to set up a development environment and get you ready to write code.

ESLint开发与在命令行上运行有些不同。本节将向你展示如何设置开发环境，并且让你准备好写代码。

## Section 3: Run the [Unit Tests](unit-tests)

There are a lot of unit tests included with ESLint to make sure that we're keeping on top of code quality. This section explains how to run the unit tests.

ESLint中有很多单元测试来确保我们保持高质量的代码。本节解释如何运行单元测试。

## Section 4: [Working with Rules](working-with-rules)

You're finally ready to start working with rules. You may want to fix an existing rule or create a new one. This section explains how to do all of that.

你终于开始使用该规则了。你可能想要修复一个现有规则或创建一个新的。本节解释如何做到这些。

## Section 5: [Working with Plugins](working-with-plugins)

You've developed library-specific rules for ESLint and you want to share it with the community. You can publish an ESLint plugin on npm.

你为ESLint开发了特定的规则，想分享到社区。你在npm上发布一个ESLint插件。

## Section 6: [Node.js API](nodejs-api)

If you're interested in writing a tool that uses ESLint, then you can use the Node.js API to get programmatic access to functionality.

如果你很感兴趣使用ESLint写一个工具，你可以使用Node.js API。

## Section 7: [Contributing](contributing/)

Once you've made changes that you want to share with the community, the next step is to submit those changes back via a pull request.

一旦你做出改变，想分享到社区，下一步就是通过发送请求提交这些改变。
